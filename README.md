# Social Media Network API# 

## Description
NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API

- This is a challenge to build an API for a social networking web app. 
Users can share thoughts, react to friends thoughts and create a friend list. 

- I used Express.js for routing, a MONGODB database, and the MONGOOSE ODM. 
- MOd18 Social Network uses a NOSQL database so the app can handle large amounts of 
unstructred data. 


## Installation
Need: Express, MongoDb, Mongoose, Valid Email, Insomnia. 

## Usage
For education. 
Screenshots added.
